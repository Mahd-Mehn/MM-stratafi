# üèÜ Project: **Aptos StrataFi**

### The One-Liner

**StrataFi** is a decentralized protocol that tokenizes real-world credit assets and automatically structures them into risk-tranched investment products, powered by an AI-driven risk engine on Aptos.

### The Vision: Wall Street's Engine, Rebuilt for Web3

The global market for structured credit (like Collateralized Debt Obligations) is valued in the trillions, yet it's opaque, inefficient, and inaccessible to most. DeFi has so far failed to replicate this market due to the technical limitations of older blockchains‚Äînamely slow execution, high fees, and the inability to handle complex, multi-party financial logic atomically.

**StrataFi‚Äôs vision is to build the foundational layer for structured credit on-chain.** We turn the world's private debt‚Äîfrom invoice financing to real estate loans‚Äîinto liquid, transparent, and composable DeFi primitives. We're not just building another DeFi app; we're building a core piece of the "Global Trading Engine" that Aptos is destined to become.

## Why StrataFi Wins

StrataFi is designed to excel across all judging criteria by combining  **technical sophistication** ,  **market novelty** , and  **deep ecosystem composability** .

### 1. Unmatched Technical Sophistication (Wins "Best Tech Implementation")

This isn't just another fork or a simple UI. StrataFi leverages the full power of the Aptos stack to do what is impossible on EVM chains.

* **Atomic Tranching & Payment Waterfalls:** The core of structured finance is the "payment waterfall," where cashflows are distributed to different risk tranches (Senior, Mezzanine, Junior) in a specific order. On EVM chains, this is slow and risky. **On Aptos, we use ****parallel execution** to process these complex, multi-recipient distributions atomically in a single transaction.^1^ If one part fails, the whole transaction reverts, eliminating settlement risk.
* **Move's Safety for Financial Primitives:** Each tranche and tokenized asset is a secure  **Move Object** . This prevents re-entrancy bugs and double-spending issues that plague traditional smart contract platforms, ensuring institutional-grade security for real-world financial assets.
* **AI-Powered Risk Oracle:** We've built an off-chain AI agent named **"Helios"** that acts as a dynamic underwriting oracle.
  * **Continuous Underwriting:** Helios ingests both on-chain data (via **Nodit's** indexers) and off-chain real-world data (e.g., credit scores, property valuations) to generate a real-time **"Portfolio Health Score."**
  * **On-Chain Publication:** This score is published on-chain, providing a transparent, dynamic risk metric for all tranches that other DeFi protocols can integrate. This is a core, value-add use of AI, not a superficial chatbot.

### 2. Radical Novelty in DeFi (Wins the Main Track)

While many submissions are excellent implementations of existing ideas (perpetuals, payment links, prediction markets), StrataFi introduces a new, high-value primitive to the DeFi space.

* **Beyond Simple RWA Tokenization:** Projects like `AptoStock` and `RealMint` are about tokenizing single assets. StrataFi goes a level deeper by  **structuring pools of these assets** , which is where the real financial engineering and value creation happens.
* **Solving Real-World Liquidity:** We solve the illiquidity of private credit by tokenizing tranches and creating instant secondary markets for them.
* **Tailored Risk for Everyone:** Investors are no longer limited to "apeing" or "stable farming." They can choose their risk exposure:
  * **Senior Tranche:** Stable, low-risk yield, perfect as top-tier collateral in lending protocols.
  * **Mezzanine Tranche:** Balanced risk and reward.
  * **Junior Tranche:** High-risk, high-yield, leveraged exposure for sophisticated investors.

### 3. Deep Ecosystem Composability (Hits All the Marks)

StrataFi is designed to be a "DeFi lego" that plugs into the entire Aptos ecosystem, directly addressing partner bounties.

* **Hyperion & Tapp.Exchange Integration:** We will create automated, concentrated liquidity pools on **Hyperion** and **Tapp** for our tokenized tranches (e.g., `sUSDC`/`USDC`). This provides immediate liquidity for investors and drives volume to our partners, fulfilling the **"Hyperion Liquidity & Capital Efficiency Challenge"** and the **"Next-Gen DeFi"** bounty.
* **Nodit API Integration:** Our AI Risk Oracle, Helios, relies on **Nodit's** Web3 Data API and Indexer API to monitor the on-chain health of our RWA portfolios, satisfying the **"Build with Nodit"** challenge.
* **Future Integrations:** The low-risk senior tranche tokens are perfect for use as collateral in lending protocols like Aries, or to build structured products with partners like  **Kana Labs** , opening up possibilities for options and perpetuals backed by real-world yield.

## ## The Submission BUIDL

### 1. The Product

* **A sleek, intuitive dApp** that abstracts away the complexity. Users can explore different RWA pools (e.g., "Invoice Factoring Pool #1," "Real Estate Bridge Loan Pool #2"), view the AI Health Score, and invest in their chosen tranche (Senior, Mezzanine, or Junior) with USDC in one click.
* **A powerful dashboard** showing real-time yield, portfolio health, and upcoming cashflow distributions.

### 2. The Demo

Our live demo on testnet will showcase the entire lifecycle:

1. An RWA portfolio is tokenized and deposited into a StrataFi vault.
2. The AI Risk Oracle analyzes the portfolio and publishes an initial Health Score on-chain.
3. A user connects their Petra wallet and invests USDC into the Senior Tranche, receiving `sUSDC` tokens.
4. Another user invests in the high-yield Junior Tranche.
5. We simulate a payment from the RWA pool, and the UI visually shows the  **waterfall distribution** , with Senior investors being paid first.
6. We simulate a partial default in the RWA pool, and the UI shows the Junior tranche absorbing the loss while the Senior tranche remains protected.

### 3. The Code

* **GitHub Repo:** A monorepo with three main packages:
  1. **`/contracts`:** Exceptionally well-documented Move contracts for the vaults, tranche engine, and oracle publisher.
  2. **`/helios-ai-agent`:** The Python-based off-chain AI agent with clear documentation on its models and data sources (integrating Nodit).
  3. **`/frontend`:** A production-quality Next.js/React application showcasing the dApp.

This project isn't just an idea; it's a complete, technically superior, and strategically aligned platform that demonstrates the true power of Aptos as the future's Global Trading Engine.
